    "Description": "I think this would be the easiest way to allow a member to control if they get emails.  If you can accept the requirement that to be a member of the clubsite requires you to receive emails.  Which for what I am considering using this for it makes sense.  So I added the following code to Member\\Details.aspx\n \n1. The @Register at the top for the Ajax Control Toolkit.\n<%@ Register Assembly=\"AjaxControlToolkit\" Namespace=\"AjaxControlToolkit\" TagPrefix=\"cc1\" %>\n \n2. Added a section to the bottom of the page with the UI for deleting a member.  This uses the Ajax Control Toolkit just to give a confimation box.  \n \n            <div class=\"rightblock\">\n                <h2>\n                    Delete your membership\n                </h2>\n                <div class=\"dashedline\">\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                    You can cancel your membership in this club by clicking on the button below. If\n                    you cancel your membership, you will be removed from the roster and will no longer\n                    receive emails from the club leadership.\n                </p>\n                <asp:Button runat=\"server\" ID=\"btnCancel\" Text=\"Delete Membership\" OnClick=\"btnCancel_Click\" />\n                <cc1:ConfirmButtonExtender ID=\"ConfirmButtonExtender1\" runat=\"server\" TargetControlID=\"btnCancel\" ConfirmText=\"Are you sure you want to delete your membership?\">\n                </cc1:ConfirmButtonExtender>\n            </div>\n \n3. And finally the code for the cancel button click:\n    Protected Sub btnCancel_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)\n        Dim user As MembershipUser = Membership.GetUser()\n        Dim da As New DataSetTableAdapters.MemberInfoTableAdapter\n        da.Delete(CType(user.ProviderUserKey, Guid))\n        Membership.DeleteUser(user.UserName, True)\n        FormsAuthentication.SignOut()\n        Response.Redirect(\"~/Default.aspx\")\n    End Sub\n \nI am also attaching the file.",
