    "Description": "G'day\n \nJust installed two club sites, early days yet. Noticed that the statistics page redirected to the home page. Removed the redirect code and get season 2007 dates in 1900? Seems that if you hit the set default season link it breaks.  Also a cancel button on some of the new team/season/player dialogs would be good.\n \nHave been using the subsonic site to some success and will make some admin/stats pages for cricket and afl football if anyone is interested. And PLEASE PLEASE is the C# version coming soon been vaiting vaiting and finally went for it....",
