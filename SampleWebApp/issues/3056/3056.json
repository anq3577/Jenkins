The Albums table in the database used to have the following columns:\r\n\r\nalbumid,title, parentid, ownerid, private\r\n\r\nThe current build of the database extended the schema a bit to give more detailed information (adding a description field).  The new schema looks like:\r\n\r\nalbumid,title, parentid, isprivate, description, ownerid\r\n\r\nSyncing to the latest code I see that this is still and open issue.  In my own usage I have implemented a fix.  I will see about joining the project to check in the fix or pass the fix along to another developer.  If you want the code fix straight from me let me know and I'll e-mail you the appropriate solution.",
