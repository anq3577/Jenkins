Sometimes I think the whole procedure of registering is a mountain people sometimes don't want to climb.You could perhaps invite people with default properties for address and a simple Username and Password. (Hoping once they are overwhelmed by the content of the site they can then update their membership).",

What I did was make everyone who joins not active, fire off an email to myself to login and change them to active if they belong.  I have had the suggestion to add a \"password\" that would be needed to be able to join.  I don't know if I am going to do that yet, as I don't see a point.  Right now my site has 4 or 5 members.  Come August, it will have 60-70, and that is where it will stay.",
