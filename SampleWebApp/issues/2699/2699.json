    "Description": "With the changes that I am making for the different image storage location, I am using a setting in the web.config.  I think that we need an additional page in the admin area to enable settings changes without loading web.config in an editor.\n \nOr maybe just a first launch page, to be used the first time the site is installed.  Have it work like this:\n \n1. New site admin launches settings.aspx\n2. New site admin adjusts the site settings (club name, website address, etc).  They click Save.\n3. New site admin creates a user login that automatically gets added to Administrators.\n4. Page redirects to Default.aspx.\n5. Part of Page_Load for Default.aspx deletes settings.aspx if it is present.\n \nObviously, this is a one-time thing.  But that would make it easier for new sites to be configured, sortof runs right out of the box.",
