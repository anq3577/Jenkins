    "Description": "Brand new to this, I have been programming for a number of years but am new to ASP.NET.\n \nWhile playing with the kit found a bugs with the RSVP system.\n \nISSUE:\nThere is a place on the RSVP system that tells you how many more attendees permitted to attend. This is initially correct. If my max is 10 and I put in 3 it will say I have 7 left. If I leave the page and come back and check how many attendees can be added it always is decremented by 1, in the example it would now say 9\n \nBUG:\nIn the Events.vb file under the subroutine RSVPSanityCheck() there is a query statement \n\t\t\t\tDim sum As Integer = attnqry.GetCount(Attendance.Columns.Numofguest, where)\nThis does not return the number of attendees for this login, it returns the number of records.\n \nSOLUTION:\nChanged the query from GetCount to GetSum and added a check to make sure there was one record in the database before using the GetSum query. So now the code looks like this:\n \n        Public Shared Sub RSVPSanityCheck(ByVal EventID As Integer)\n            Dim attnqry As New Query(Tables.Attendance)\n            Dim where As New SubSonic.Where\n            where.ColumnName = Attendance.Columns.Eventid\n\t\t\twhere.ParameterValue = EventID\n\t\t\tIf attnqry.GetCount(Attendance.Columns.Numofguest, where) > 0 Then\n\t\t\t\tDim sum As Integer = attnqry.GetSum(Attendance.Columns.Numofguest, where)\n \n\t\t\t\tDim upqry As New Query(Tables.ClubEvent)\n\t\t\t\tupqry.AddWhere(ClubEvent.Columns.Id, EventID)\n\t\t\t\tupqry.AddUpdateSetting(ClubEvent.Columns.CurrentAttendance, sum)\n\t\t\t\tupqry.QueryType = QueryType.Update\n\t\t\t\tupqry.Execute()\n\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\tEnd Sub\n \nLet me know if you agree with this fix. There might be a better way to make sure there are records available before summing.\n \nThanks,\n \nJim Shelton",
