It was a truly memorable event, beating big clubs like Crawley and Belgrave so comprehensively, and the club should be extremely proud of everyone who took part. The individual results are attached.The final match scores were as follows:Poole Runners             206.5 points Crawley                       165 Sutton/Belgrave            155 Horsham                      133.5 Redhill                          96 Istead & Iford                 86 Swale                           62A very big thankyou too to the drivers, Mike Phillips and Pete Moore, and to Pete, Mike and Rex Bale for officialling. It reflects well on the club to have such competent officials, as well as athletes who step in to help out, as Peter Budden and Jon Boyle did yesterday. The final match of the season is at the new track at Crawley on 4 August. This is a very big fixture if we want to get promotion. This time we are up against East Grinstead (the form team), Holland Sports and Serpentine, all of whom are strong clubs. We need to come at least 2nd. Unfortunately I will be away on holiday, and so will James, Mike and Nic. Jon will be at the South of England Combined Events Championships at Bedford. So we really need all the available athletes to be there to support Keith Fraser, who will again step in as acting team captain/manager for the day. Please can everyone e-mail me to say whether or not they can turn out for the team on that day, and also whether they can and are willing to drive. Many thanks, DavidDavid Ozanne",
