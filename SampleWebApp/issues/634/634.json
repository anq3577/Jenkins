    "Description": "I am getting a Microsoft JScript runtime error: 'length' is null or not an object whenever I navigate to the edit page for events.  The only way I can make this go away is to comment out the FCK Editor.\n \nThe part that is throwing the error is in FCKeditor/editor/js/fckeditorcode_ie.js:\n \nString.prototype.ReplaceAll=function(A,B){\n    var C=this;\n    for (var i=0;i<A.length;i++){\n        C=C.replace(A[i],B[i]);\n    };\n    return C;\n};\n \nI expanded this to make it more readable.  I don't know why it is calling ReplaceAll when I clicked Add New Event.",
