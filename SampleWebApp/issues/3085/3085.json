      "Message": "Probably because they were created by two different programmers.  The Club Starter Kit that we have is an improvement of the original MS supplied Kit.  A big improvement, but it still is based on that original kit.  If I remember correctly, the only things done to news and events pages were bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAlso remember that the events feed the calendar, while the news section doesn't have to.  So maybe the formview was an easier way to program it, but wasn't sufficient for the events.",
