    "Description": "I have been asked by my club  www.mad-tri.com  to see if we can record race results on the site.\n \nThis way we can record what each member has achived and see if they have improved on a year by year bases.\n \nWhen a race result is record it needs to be against a member, a location, and an event.  Which all ties in nicely.  Also it can be extended to the RSVP option that is being requested.\n \nNow for the tricky part, what and how much of the race results do we capture?\n \nFor example in a Triathlon there are a number of times you can capture:\n \n\tTime for the Swim\n\tDistance of the swim\n\tTime for transition 1\n\tTime for the cycle\n\tDistance of the cycle\n\tTime for transition 2\n\tTime for the run\n\tDistance of the run\n \nThen you can have positions for each time and distance.\n \nSo you can see it could get quite complex.\n \nI welcome peoples comments and any requirements they might have on this subject.",

      "Message": "Try to think more generally.  Because while you are thinking specifically about a triathalon, this should be workable for marathons, drag races with multiple heats, golf games recording score on each hole, etc.\r\n\r\nAn event can already be tied to a location.  That is one of the selections possible when creating an event.  Members are tied to an event if they rsvp.\r\n\r\nAre you thinking of having the race director entering all the times, or each member entering his/hers own times?  \r\n\r\nMaybe we need to think of doing this as plug-ins, rather than over-generalizing it.  One plug-in for triathalons, another for marathons, etc.  \r\n\r\nFor triathalons, what about a table that has a event id, member id, then columns for the rest (swim time, etc).  Then have a gridview that shows the results and allows them to be edited by race directors.  The gridview would be populated from an event id in the query string, and pull the results out of the database.  userid would be a drop-down column, so that the race director could select which userid for that row, then just tab through it entering the times.  \r\n\r\nDo the distances for each leg stay the same for each location, or is each event at the same location different?  If they are different, then you would want another table with eventid and the distance for each leg entered.  Don't worry too much about the location, as each event will have its own location and that is already in the event table (or location table, can't remember right now).\r\n\r\nSo have a EventDistance table with columns (eventid, swimDistance, cycleDistance, runDistance) and a EventResults table with columns (event id, memberid (or userid), swimTime, transitionOneTime, cycleTime, transitionTwoTime, runTime).",

      "Message": "I can see the idea of a seperate plug in for each type of sport, but I'd like to have ago of making a general plugin for sports in general.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking along the lines that the Administrator will setup the type of Races to be recorded, and customise it for each type of Club/Race, ut once configured it will be fixed for the site.\r\n\r\nI was going for a two stage approach, the first phase would only allow a race director to enter the information, and then the second phase would allow for members to enter there own information.\r\n\r\nI'll think about this some more, thanks for your comments most welcome.",

      "Message": "I'm a new member here and want to thank you all for the work being done with the CSK. I represent a Sprint Car racing organization and have put together a site to track our race results for the season. http://www.RenegadeSprints.org was built from scratch, but I'm working on modifying the CSK Beta 2.0 to incorporate the results pages from our current site and build the schedule into the events calendar. \r\n\r\nIf you go to Overall Standings/Weekly Results on the menu bar you will see the type of results we track, which might be helpful as you design a race results plug-in that works with multiple activities. Standings from each track, as well as Overall Standings are maintained separately and will appear on the respective pages when the season starts in a couple of weeks. Currently there are only some pre-season, non-points race results on the Weekly Results pages.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!   ",

      "Message": "In a previous post on this topic, I stated that I was working on incorporating our race results from an existing site into the Club Site framework. That has now been done, based on Version 2-RC1. ( http://test.renegadesprints.org ) I still have a couple of FireFox issues to work out, but other than that, it's working pretty well.\r\n\r\nThe method I chose was to create a separate database for all driver/race results information and use gridview and detailview controls to display the data. This required no programming at all to accomplish which is a good thing because I'm definately not a programmer. Our first points race is this week(4/13/07), so by next week, there should be Overall and Individual Track standings to go along with the Driver and Weekly Race results that are currently there.",

      "Message": "Hi There\r\n\r\nThis discussion on recording race result is 60% of what my club site needs to be about and I have been playing with it for a while.\r\n\r\nI am building a site for a local running club (and the work you guys are doing is fantastic).  The running club needs to record results not only for its own members but it also hosts a few races a year and publishes the results on its web site.  Currently it will do this via a simple HTML table, but I am trying to learn to put all this information in a gridview.\r\n\r\nI have come up with a partial solution, please take a look at www.poolerunners.com.ultimahosts.net and browse to results.\r\n\r\nThe functionality is basic but essentially what I want is to be able to publish and sort the races and names better, something like this:  http://www.sirisaac.co.uk/raceresults06.html\r\n\r\nI would also like to be able to populate the members results from the same database under thier profile?  Maybe a bit to much to ask, but, the biggie for me is adding the records in the database.\r\n\r\nNow obviously this can be done through a add in the gridview, but I will often get a list of 200 results in CSV format from the race director.  Instead of typing them all in I want to merge the csv file to the database.  I can use a SQL manager program, but that means I have to do it rather than a team of administators, it would be great if I could have a update area to bulk upload the file and merge it in.\r\n\r\nHope this helps?\r\n\r\nCheers",
