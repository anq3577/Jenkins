    "Description": "Time selection (Club:Durationpicker) limited to 6:00 AM - 11:30 PM.  (24 hour seams more flexible)\nI changed it to support 24 hour in RC1 (still reviewing 1709).\n \nCan manually add time and or text (i.e. test start time and test end time) \nIf you type in 7 for start time and 12 for end time it defaults to 12:00 AM - 12:00AM as is would for all other invalid entries.\n \nConcern: What if you don’t realize you have typed an invalid entry.  Unless you verify, you would not know your event time is 12AM-12AM.\n \nRegards,\nHotaling",
