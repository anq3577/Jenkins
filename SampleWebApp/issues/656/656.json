    "Description": "I ran into the same problem that I had before after I downloaded the latest source.\n \nI don't know which version of FCKeditor that is included in the source, but it will not work under IE7.  \n \nWhen I use FCKeditor version 2.3.3, it works fine.  When using 2.4 it crashes giving me the errors that I reported yesterday.\n \nFor now, I will have to keep deleting the FCKeditor folder and put 2.3.3 in.",
