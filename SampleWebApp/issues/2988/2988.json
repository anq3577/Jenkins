If you already delete them from the Database with out deleteing them from  the site as much as you try to delete them from the site it will not work so delete the from the site only.",

      "Message": "Perhaps we should add a script into the dev folder, which restores all the example data (without the admin account).After a look into the database I think a truncate table would suffice in most cases.When yes, add and call a \"restore\" StoredProcedure or do everything in the aspx file?Another possibility is that you later can restore your ClubSite to the original state (perhaps with an automatic backup).",
