    "Description": "Step 2 (member details)  of the user create form in register.aspx completes without validation. I have also checked this form in all three of the wesites built with 2.0 that are listed on the home page. I think this is an important issue that needs to be addressed. A user is now able to leave the member details first name and last name blank and finish creating a user account. I am trying to build a member registry of club members and some of them have no member details filled in. I would greatly ajppreciate this issue given some consideration. Thank you.",
