    "Description": "Hello, I am new to this forum and would like to thank very much the hard work put in by everyone in creating this wonderful resource.\n \nThe only bug that I seem to be unable to solve thus far is when I go to create or edit an event in the \"events\" section.  When I upload an image I have no problem in having the event description display with the correct image.  However when I try to reference an existing image using the \"Existing Image\" button I am able to access the photo galleries but nothing updates.  I am left with the default image \"f.jpg\" regardless of what I select.\n \nAny suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank-you very much for your time; have a great day!\n \nEDIT: It is also broken when using the \"News\" section, but for the life of me I can't see the error in PhotoAlbumPicker.acsx or PhotosFormPicker.acsx.",
