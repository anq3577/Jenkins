Does anyone have a scenario and some examples of how the data would be displayed?<br /><br /></div><br />What I would like to see is for a soccer team site:<br /><br />A club contains a number of teams.<br /><br />Competition containing X teams Where from a competition one team belongs to the club. The rest are teams from other clubs. All teams playing an X number of times (usually 2) against each other.<br />Winning gives ie 3 point, a draw 1 point , loose = 0 point.<br />That would be the competition part.<br /><br />Apart from that there are also team statistics. (for us much more of importance) <br />a Season(Year) consist of Team consist of players. This way it is possible to build a history of the career of the players.<br />For teams gamereports could be written (accually news items with pictures that can be linked te albums all in the context of a season).<br /><br />I am thinking of how it would be displayed on the screen, but it gives an idea of how I want to have it for my club.  <br /><br />",

Which data would be the value. A rating or something?<br /><br />A model that I think would help a lot of clubs is the following:<br /><br />Season<br />--------<br />id<br />Name (string)<br />StartDate <br />EndDate<br /><br /><br />Teams<br />--------<br />id<br />Name<br />LeaderMemKey (membership GUID)<br />SeasonID<br />TeamPhoto (Link to a photalbum?)<br /><br />PlayerInTeam<br />---------------<br />PlayerID<br />TeamID<br />PlayerPhoto (link to a photoalbum?)<br /><br />Players<br />--------<br />id<br />memkey<br /><br />PlayerStats<br />----------<br />id<br />StatName<br />Value (bool, string, int)<br /><br />PayersInStatsByGame<br />---------<br />statid<br />Value<br />gameid<br /><br />GameResults<br />--------<br />gameid<br />team1id<br />team2id<br />Season<br />Date<br />Winner (int: 1 (team 1), 2 (team 2), 0 (tie), -1 (not played yet)<br />ResultScore<br />newsID (link to the news entities for storing gamereviews and photo's)<br /><br /><br />****<br />I hope this gives you an idea. This way there can be build a history of the career of players and the accompanied teams they where in. Also it is possible to easely retrieve newsarticles (gameresults) for a given team in a given season.<br />",

Also calculating GAA (Goals Allowed Average).<br /><br />All of the come off of the NJCAA web site for Junior colelges.  Each goal is worth 2 point and assists are 1 point.  As with most sports, the player with the most points is the team leader.<br /><br />I can elaborate more if you would like.<br /><br />Bob<br />",

Ok that's possible. <br />Usually the signing in into the website does not reflect the players that are physically member of the club. The players are all member of the Dutch soccer accociation. <br />It is ok because we just have to add them only once although there are 700 members ;)<br /><br />What I do need is a Team photo season related and a cross table between the team and players also season related because players are changing of team every season.<br /><br />The idea I had for the user interface is:<br /><br />Dropdown menu for selecting the team.<br /><br />Left allocated menu (per team ) for the following items (pages):<br /><br /><ul><li>Teamfoto (default page)</li><li>Selecting year (default from webconfig)</li><li>Playersinfo (form with the picture and possibly some career info/stats. This possible when making the players(career)info season dependant)</li><li>Game reports (copy of newspage in the context of the teams and season) </li><li>Game result (scores and standings (Is this correct English? I mean the possition in the competition related to other team))</li><li>photo gallery (team and season related)</li></ul><br />It looks quite extensive, but I think many clubs (especially the soccer teams in western europe) will benefit from this because they all think in this way.<br /><br /><br />Keep up the good work<br /><br />Robert<br />",
