That was based on reading about problems with them on the asp.net forums. <br /><br />With webhost4life, I know that my scripts that I use only have the CREATE Table... up to GO.

I think they have one post with fixes for godaddy.<br />",

The only problem I had with the scripts is they had two images within the script that made the file huge, so huge it would lock up Notepad or whatever I was using to open them.  <br /><br />Now when I make changes to the database (in the local SQL Express db), I open SQL Server Management Express, right-click the table and choose Script (something.  I don't have it in front of me).  Then I copy the script to the Query Analyzer that the web host provides.<br /><br />Like I said above, I just copy the portion from CREATE down to GO.<br />",
