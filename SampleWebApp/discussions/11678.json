I modified the CSK, but only mostly verbage and additional menu options.  Did not change the database or the structure of the site.  I followed the instructions in the thread titled \"GoDaddy Installation Walkthrough\" from the ASP.NET web site.<br /><br />I'm at a point where when i open IE and go to my website, it gives the error \"The database does not appear to contain WebContent table, this is a feature of the extended ClubSite, please ensure you have run WebContent.SQL against the database\".  <br /><br />Does anybody know where \"webcontent.sql\" is?  I searched all over this site and ASP.NET site and cannot find it or any mention of it.<br /><br />Any help would be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

I only remember doing one script and i don't remember which one.  That might be the problem.  Following the instructions from \"GoDaddy Installation Walkthrough\" from the ASP.NET web site, it says to use \"club-add.sql\", so i only did one script.<br /><br />If i do both scripts from Scripts.zip, from this site, do i do both the same way? and does the order matter?<br /><br />After hearing from you about the above questions, i will probably try making a new database as you suggest.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",
