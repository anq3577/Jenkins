I realize go daddy is terrible, but could anyone outline the process. You do not have the ability to utilize the asp.net configuration tool when you upload. Would I need to start from scratch assign admin user/s locally then upload and run sql script and setup database or has anyone found a way to add a admin account when site is uploaded and up and running?? Again, I appreciate your help - this site is a great resource <br /><br />Began from scratch - made sure to add a couple of admin accounts locally  I ran the schema.sql file in the query analyzer and received an error messages. It created the tables <br /><br />Used the database publishing wizard to publish local \"ClubDB.mdf\" and received back \"successful\" went to go try the admin accounts with the following error message:<br /><br />The 'System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider' requires a database schema compatible with schema version '1'.  However, the current database schema is not compatible with this version.  You may need to either install a compatible schema with aspnet_regsql.exe (available in the framework installation directory), or upgrade the provider to a newer version.<br /><br />checked \"install schema\" on setup and still no luck<br /><br />Anyone have a idea?<br />",

If I do it locally (create user, and assign role) with the configuration manager; will it work when you post? If you run the schema.sql script, I get  error 2147217900 \"Incorrect syntax near 'addAttendance'. <br /><br />I open the schema.sql with notepad edit select all, copy and paste into query analyzer and recieve that error.<br /><br />I have version 1 up and running. the sql script was processed successful and was able to pull the ids out for my user name and assign administrators rights. I have not had luck with version 2, but i certainly will keep trying. I want to thank you for your comments and suggestions (I will get version 2 with your help) I think its the schema.sql script (do you copy and paste the entire file into query analyzer?<br />",

Took a little much needed vacation.<br /><br />Not knowing your exact configurations of your boxes makes it hard to troubleshoot your issues.  Is your win2k box a server install or a professional install.  Do you have SQL2005 on your XP box or SQL express?  I would guess the error is being caused by different configurations on the two boxes.  The old saying \"whats different\" holds true.<br /><br />The example config I provided was for SQL2000/2005.<br /><br />rhhanson<br />",
