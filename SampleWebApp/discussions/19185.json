We now have about 200 content pages, some with pictures. This will continue to grow ... FCKeditor seems like a good start, but it is not clear from any documentation I can find how to set this up.<br /><br />Thanks for helping such a non-techie!<br /><br />Deborah (web master for Mid-Hudson Road Runners Club)<br />",
