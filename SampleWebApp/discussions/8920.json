Please take a look at my hiking club website first built with the original starter kit, I then ommited the news and events sections beause of all the bugs. My site now uses your latest build. I have more work to do but I really think that your project contains some nice work and features and I cannot thank you enough. It makes me look great as our club webmaster.<br /><br />For the future maybe others could get involved in creating more themes.<br /><br />Thank you again.<br /><br />Temporary until I change the DNS. <br /><br />http://sahcinfo.org.ultimahosts.net/<br /><br />",
