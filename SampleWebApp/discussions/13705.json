Everything works fine on the members/registration page, but nothing updates on the member/details page (it works fine in the original starter kit without the added fields). I have checked and rechecked the code after following the procedure on adding membership fields (and done it more than once to be sure). <br /><br />Has anyone tried this to be sure the instructions work? I am considering just using VWDE with a details view allowing editing on the memberInfo table so it will work properly and skipping all this complexity. Any gotchas if I do this?<br /><br />",
