Navigation work fine on my local development server, but when hosted, I get the below error whenever navigating from the main menu to a page that is located in a folder. If the page is in the root directory, it works OK. <a href=\"http://version2.renegadesprints.org\" class=\"externalLink\">http://version2.renegadesprints.org<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a> On that site, Results, Photos and Rules are in the root, other pages are in sub-directories.<br /><br />Could this be due to the fact that this site is a sub-site of my primary domain, and if so, how can I fix it?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ed<br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Cannot use a leading .. to exit above the top directory. <br />Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request.

I would suggest that you add themes in by adding EnableThemes at the top of the masterpage to true and adding a new theme. You will also need to add a &lt;page theme=\"~~~~~\"&gt; to the web.config.<br /><br />Better yet, you could upgrade to RC1 if you are using beta 2... they are quite similar.<br />",
