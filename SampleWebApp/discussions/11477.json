They all display as just plain text.<br /><br />I also have the other Club Web Site starter kit from ASP.NET and it's aspx pages <u>do</u> display as near-WYSIWYG ok.<br /><br />Does anybody know why this is happening with the CSK 2.0?<br /><br />Any help would be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

Visual Studio doesn't support themes in design-time. I think they should!<br /><br />What you can do is link the stylesheet from your theme folder to the stylesheet in the masterpage then take it out once you launch.<br />",
