Our users create essays (with text formatting, pictures, etc.) and now I create a new page for each essay. Is there instructions for fckeditor so a user could create a new essay and it is accessed through some table of contents and then they are displayed on just one page after a user selects the appropriate essay to view? I have looked around for intstuctions for this, but can't seem to find any ... fckeditor works great on a single, already created page.<br /><br />Sorry to be so dense on this ... thanks in advance for your help.<br />",
