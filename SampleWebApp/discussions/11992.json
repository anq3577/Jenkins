I was thinking of having something like my bank does for reoccuring funds transfers.  Select how often the reoccur (weekly, monthly, first tuesday of the month, the 25th of every month, etc), and have a choice of either it reoccuring x times or until an end date.<br /><br />I think I will also make an option to automatically delete the old events once the date has passed, to keep the db from filling up.<br />",
