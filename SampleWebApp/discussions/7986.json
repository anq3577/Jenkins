They told me to convert my SQL file to a CSV and upload it using their web-console tool.<br /><br />What worked for me to get to where we are today was to create an EMPTY DB and loaded the Schema SQL File First, THEN add the Schema and DSN that GoDaddy provides.<br /><br />Then I uploaded the DATA SQL file minus the HUGE Image that is on it.<br /><br />There are a lot of bugs with the website, but it is working for now.<br /><br />good luck<br />Mike<br />",
