There was a comment by Zac that he thought he had fixed it, but no follow-up to indicate when or where.<br /><br />The problem is that when you click on Next Page from News List, you are returned to the first page of News. You can get to the older News Articles by selecting an article and then using the Previous and Next links, so I know they exist. My site (<a href=\"http://www.RenegadeSprints.org\" class=\"externalLink\">http://www.RenegadeSprints.org<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a>) is based on V2-RC1 and I would like to get this working properly without going through the problems of upgrading to V3, only to find that the problem might still be there.<br /><br />Ed<br />",
