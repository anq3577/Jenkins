When I try to login â€“ I get 'dbo.aspnet_CheckSchemaVersion' . I have double and triple checked all connection strings, etc. <br /><br />I have tried many different solutions but to no luck. <br /><br />To confirm that the problem is on my side - I used the scripts and the source for the Club Site 2.0 to try to run them on my hosting provider and stopped at the schema.sql ... fixed it a bit, but now I get the zowens error. There was a discussion on this one too, but it does not seem to come up with any definite answer.<br />Has anyone had any luck with these issues?<br />I think it will be very nice if one of the team members works up a step by step instruction of how to install the site on hosting environment. <br />I am willing to put small donation on a paypal account on one of the developers on the team for a working installation instruction, if this would speed things up.<br />Nikolay<br />",
