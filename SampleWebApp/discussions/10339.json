Simple as that and you may also edit your tables with the same program on the server. Hope this helps, if you need more info, support at Ultimatehosts is great or contackt me for more info.<br />",

The tech support was quicker and more complete than I found with GoDaddy or ipowerweb. Installation involved a couple of reinstalls for the kit whenever I screwed it up, some instructions about not using SQL Express, entering some dummy  data to initiate the events links, and re-attaching the database a couple times. I could not have done any of this by myself, but the site works now and I will be shamelessly mimicking the Troop 14 Scout site for my own scout troop.<br />",
