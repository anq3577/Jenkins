But I cannot find how I am suppose to reset a users password if they forget it,  other than deleting there account and recreating it.  Is there a button I could add for the administrator to use to send a password to a user, or is there some sql stored procedure i could use temporarly.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Spencer<br />",
