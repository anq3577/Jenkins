The validation on the first screen works fine, the member details validation on the second step of the create user wizard form does not work. It has validation controls setup for the first and last names fields but still processes the form to completion without and data entered into these fields. Although it does work locally, when the form is published on the service the validation does not work. Does anyone have any insight on this problem?<br /><br />I have noticed if I leave the wizard on step 2 and test it locally the validation works, if I change it to step 1 and test it, the form completes without validation.<br /><br />The validation on the second step of http://club.eagleenvision.net/member/register.aspx does not work either.<br />",
