When I upload an image I have no problem in having the event description display with the correct image.  However when I try to reference an existing image using the \"Existing Image\" button I am able to access the photo galleries but nothing updates.  I am left with the default image \"f.jpg\" regardless of what I select.<br /><br />Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank-you very much for your time; have a great day!<br /><br />EDIT: It is also broken when using the \"News\" section, but for the life of me I can't see the error in PhotoAlbum<i>Picker.acsx or Photos</i>FormPicker.acsx.<br />",

Albums are album ID32 and 33.  Images are:<br /><br />18     Album ID 32<br />19     Album ID 32<br />20     Album ID 32<br />21     Album ID 33<br />22     Album ID 33<br />23     Album ID 33<br /><br />I add a new news event and try to use existing images.  I select the image and get the image with a red X in it.  When you look at the properties of the images you get the following:<br /><br />http://localhost:1174/2346ogfutbol/UserControls/imagefetch.ashx?<b>ImageID=32</b>&amp;Size=1<br /><br />It appears it is pulling the AlbumID number instead of the image ID number.  This appears to be code in the imagefetch.ashx but it may be something passed into it.<br /><br />I am continuing to TS.<br />",
