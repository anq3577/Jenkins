I can upload pictures individually into the 'holding area' (wherever that is ) and, presumably, the Upload button will take these files and load them into the system.<br /><br />Having to upload the pictures individually into the holding area does not fit with the term 'bulk upload'.  Is there a way that the client user can point to his/her photo album and bulk load the contents?<br /><br />I've set the web site to utiles the file system for photos.  Will the bulk upload respect that setting or will it load into the Db?<br />",
