Eventually, I have no more links to click on. When I click on the page links, the ObjectDataSource.Selecting event does NOT fire. It only fires when I initially come to the New/List.aspx page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a discussion on this earlier, but it was closed and never answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\n",
