Is that the way it is supposed to be.<br /><br />I noticed that the event link opens the Events\\Calendar.aspx, so i attempted to open that page in designer mode using VS2005 Pro.  When i did that, i got this error message:<br />---------------------------<br />Microsoft Visual Studio<br />---------------------------<br />Can not switch to Design view because of errors in the page. Please correct all errors labeled 'Can not switch:' in the Error List and try again.<br />---------------------------<br />OK   <br />---------------------------<br /><br />After i click OK, there are twelve errors in the error list.  The first one is this:<br />\"Error\t1\tElement 'ScriptManager' is not a known element. This can occur if there is a compilation error in the Web site.\t\"<br /><br />I don't understand how i can build the site without errors, yet opening that page causes those twelve errors.<br /><br />Any help would be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

You previously asked me if i changed any of the source code and said no.  Well, it turns out that i forgot about the steps i followed to upload this web site to GoDaddy.com.  Since then i went to discountAsp.net and never had any problems uploading my website.<br /><br />The document with the steps i followed from here: http://forums.asp.net/p/970186/1220730.aspx#1220730, showed at step 16 to change all occurences of \"dbo.\" to blank in the source code.  I'm sure that has something to do with the databases.  I followed those instructions because i thought i was going to use GoDaddy as my hoster.<br /><br />Later, when i went to discountAsp.net as a hoster, i forgot about those changes and i'm sorry for misinforming you.<br /><br />I have put all of the \"dbo.\"'s back, uploaded a clean version of the data, reattached it and things seem to be working as they should.<br /><br />Thanks for all of your help.<br /><br />Tony<br />",
