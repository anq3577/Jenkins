How could you add different levels of users to allow viewing different forum sections?<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />John Q public - Default can not access any forum group<br /><br />User level Low - can only access Forum group 1 can not edit can only read and post<br /><br />User level Medium - can only access Forum group 1 and 2 can not edit can only read and post<br /><br />Admin Level - can access Forum group 1, 2, and 3 plus edit the forums<br />",
