This caused the user information to be incomplete and I guess the Send Email function needs something in the dbo.MemberInfo table to send emails.

If your site is live I don't think you are using Visual Web Developer (VWD) to edit the live&nbsp;database (DB) anymore.&nbsp;With my provider I use&nbsp;<em><strong>SQL Server Management Studio Express</strong></em> to connect to and edit&nbsp;the live DB.&nbsp; BUT, that said if you are somehow using VDW to edit your live DB rather than you local test DB OR you&nbsp;are using some other program you can do the same thing.&nbsp; I wish we could upload screen shots with this discussion engine but I will do my best to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1). In VDW (or whatever program) open the &quot;Database Explorer&quot; palette (make sure you are connecting to your live DB.&nbsp; This step may very with use of another program like SQL Sever Management Studio Express)<br>\r\n2). Open your DB (whichever program you are using get your DB open)<br>\r\n3). Open the &quot;Tables&quot; folder<br>\r\n4). Right-Click on the &quot;<em>aspnet_Users</em>&quot; table and CLICK &quot;Show Table Data&quot;<br>\r\n5). For each users that signs-up to the site there is&nbsp;a row created and a corresponding&nbsp;&quot;<em>UserId</em>&quot; number that is generated by ASP.NET for the users.&nbsp; It is some crazy long alpha-numeric number.&nbsp; Try to print a list of this data or just keep open to cross reference.<br>\r\n6). Proceed now to the &quot;<em>MembersInfo</em>&quot; table and Right-Click and SELECT &quot;Show Table Data&quot; as well...<br>\r\n7). Look at the column &quot;<em>memberid</em>&quot;<br>\r\n8). In the &quot;<em>MembersInfo</em>&quot; table there needs to be a corresponding row for each user in the &quot;<em>aspnet_Users</em>&quot; table.&nbsp; The &quot;<em>membersid</em>&quot; column&nbsp;must&nbsp;match the &quot;<em>usersid</em>&quot; column from the &quot;<em>aspnet_Users</em>&quot; table (alpha-numberic numbers must match).<br>\r\n9). Delete or add rows to complete the tables and make them match.&nbsp;This could be dificult but just enter some data if you don't have specifics or delete the users all together and ask them to sign-up again.&nbsp; I think the mismatch happens through deleting users&nbsp;OR if they get an error midway through signing up due to slow internet traffic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think there can be more entries in the &quot;<em>MembersInfo&quot; </em>table than in the &quot;<em>aspnet_Users&quot;</em> table and that is OK but not the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope this helps...<br>\r\nmspatz\r\n",
