Also, thanks for all of the help from these forums.<br /><br />When i login in as a user with Editor Role and attempt to Modify Contact Details, after clicking the Update Info button, it displays the icon that has a circular arrow and never does anything else.  It does the same thing for an Administrator, but it does update the details.<br /><br />In the source code for the Member/Details.aspx/InitPageData sub routine, i found this paragraph:<br /><br />If dt.Rows.Count = 1 Then<br />            Dim mr As DataSet.MemberInfoRow = dt(0)<br />            UserName.Text = user.UserName<br />            fname.Text = mr.firstname<br />            lname.Text = mr.lastname<br />            Email.Text = user.Email<br />            Addr.Text = mr.address<br />            Phone.Text = mr.phone<br />            If mr.newsletter = True Then<br />                NewsletterCheck.Checked = True<br />            Else<br />                NewsletterCheck.Checked = False<br />            End If<br />            If Not mr.IsAvatarSizeNull Then<br />                avatarimage.ImageUrl = \"~\\UserControls\\AvatarImagefetch.ashx?Memberid=\" &amp; user.ProviderUserKey.ToString<br /><br />            End If<br />        End If<br /><br />Should the first line say \"If dt.Rows.Count &gt; 1 Then\" instead of \"= 1\"?<br /><br />It would make sense to me and i will probably try it, but i wanted to see if i am on the right track or if anybody else had any other ideas.<br /><br />Any help would be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

It never stops there when users other than the Administrator try to Modify Contact Details.<br /><br />So if it never executes that logic for non Administrators, is that the way it was designed?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

    "Html": "\r\nI might have changed the details view name on my website, so that is why you can't find it. I'll try to be clearer:<br /><br />1. Add membership field(s)  as shown on the Codeplex documentation <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/ClubStarterKit/Wiki/View.aspx?title=http%3a%2f%2fwww.codeplex.com%2fClubStarterKit%2fWiki%2fView.aspx%3ftitle%3dAdding%2520a%2520membership%2520field%26referringTitle%3dDocumentation\">http://www.codeplex.com/ClubStarterKit/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Adding%20a%20membership%20field&amp;referringTitle=Documentation</a> You may also have to look at the SubSonic directions for the Express or Standard editions of Visual Web Developer. (It is not hard - just carefully follow the directions).<br /><br />2. On your details (or register) page, click on the details view table where you placed your new fields for users to enter. Look for the ID name (I must have called mine dvEditMem for DetailsViewEditMember - I may have changed the name from the orginal Codeplex name while I was playing around with it). It could be called simply DetailsView1 or some such thing.)<br /><br />3. In Source View (not Design View), in the upper left of the screen, click on the dropdown list and select the ID name you found in step 2 above.<br /><br />4. Now, click on drop down list just to the right of the selected name and choose \"Item Updating.\" This will add a new event handler to your source code (between the two script tags with the other stuff already there). This is how I got \"Protected Sub dvEditMem_ItemUpdating ...\" and \"End Sub\" statements. This event handler kicks off before the database is updated and after the user clicks \"update.\"<br /><br />5. Then, between these two lines of code, start typing \"e.\"   Intellisense will show you your choices (like NewValues, etc.). Just fill in the rest of the line of code to place something else besides \"Null\" or \"nothing\" in your variable name that you don't want the user to fill out, but that you want to use someplace else. <br /><br />For instance, we want a membership end date because people pay for memberships for a certain amount of time. We don't want our users to upsdate that field, just officers. Because ClubStarter Kit won't update if there is a null value (which happens if it is not filled out by the user), my code puts in some date in the past so everyone is originally expired and then we update elsewhere. <br /><br />Hope this works for you ... I struggled with it for a while ... and there may be better solutions because I am a true novice here. Any experts out there with a better solution?<br /><br />Deborah<br />",
