I have seen a dicussion about creating a empty database in the contro panel of my hoster and then backing it up then usin the CP attachment to load the .bak file I am going to try this method wish me luck. Actually the learning curve for the control panel is incredibly hard.<br />",

What happens with an Express db, when you first try to hit it, it is attached to by SQL Server.  And it will remain attached until someone detaches it.<br /><br />The problem that you ran into is someone previous to you that is on the same web server used the database file as it comes out of the box.  Then you try and get yours to work, but SQL Server Express cannot attach it, because the previous person has theirs attached, and SQL Server Express will not allow duplicate names.<br /><br />If you still want to use SQL Server Express, rename the database file and fix the portions of web.config that say the old name.<br /><br />I haven't looked into the security parts yet, but theoretically you can access the attached db that the previous user has attached.<br />",
