The conflict occurred in database &quot;ClubSK&quot;, table &quot;dbo.MemberInfo&quot;, column 'memberid'. The statement has been terminated.&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when I am not logged in, and I try and access the same Thread, I get the following error message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&quot;Object reference not set to an instance of an object.&quot; When it tries to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDim CurrentGUID As Guid = Membership.GetUser().ProviderUserKey()<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan anyone suggest a reason why this would be happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have downloaded both the most recent source code, and version 3 Beta 1, and it seems to be happening in both.&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I doing something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary<br>\r\n",

Can you debug the code and try to find out which information are transmitted inside the SQL-Statement?!<br>\r\nDid you start&nbsp;autoscafold for subsonic after installing csk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope that helps,<br>\r\nThorsten\r\n",
