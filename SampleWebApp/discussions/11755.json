Users can post to the forum, but then the post cannot be seen.  If I look in the ms sql database I can see the post.  I have had others look at this, but to no avail.  Please help.  <br /><br />If you need to view this the site is www.carolinaskappaclub.com<br />",

Has anyone found a fix for the permissions problems when uploading the sheme to goDaddy?  Also, I just found today that the addAttendance Stored Procedure did not load.  I think my major issue is that I am missing several Stored Procedures, but I need help getting them to load properly.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br />",
