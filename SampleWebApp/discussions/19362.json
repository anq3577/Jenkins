When a new user clicks register, enters their information, then hits submit - upon submit all the box's become greyed out and the page just sites there - it does not re-direct to the default page. No errors - no nothing. But the site does work locally, just not live, I am using GoDaddy temporarily. Here is the code:<br /><br />&lt;script runat=\"server\"&gt;<br />    Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)<br />        username.Enabled = False<br />        password.Enabled = False<br />        confirmpassword.Enabled = False<br />        email.Enabled = False<br />        question.Enabled = False<br />        answer.Enabled = False<br />        Addr.Enabled = False<br />        Phone.Enabled = False<br />        fname.Enabled = False<br />        lname.Enabled = False<br />        NewsletterCheck.Enabled = False<br />        If password.Text = confirmpassword.Text Then<br />            Try<br />                Membership.CreateUser(username.Text, password.Text, email.Text, question.Text, answer.Text, True, System.Web.Security.MembershipCreateStatus.Success)<br />                Dim user As MembershipUser = Membership.GetUser(username.Text)<br />                MemberInfo.Insert(Addr.Text, Phone.Text, fname.Text, lname.Text, Nothing, CType(user.ProviderUserKey, Guid), NewsletterCheck.Checked)<br />                Membership.UpdateUser(user)<br />                If ClubStarterKit.Web.UserAdministration.NeedsEmailVerification() = True Then<br />                    user.IsApproved = False<br />                    Membership.UpdateUser(user)<br />                    ClubStarterKit.Web.UserAdministration.SendEmailVer(user)<br />                    status.Text = \"We have recieved your request.

The usernames do come up when you sign in but the Member permissions are not there.<br /><br />The live url: http://www.moenormangolfacademy.org<br />What is suppose to happen is the video's offered require a sign up, once a user signs up it takes them to the proper page or video they selected. But when they are on the register and sign up - it greys out boxes, it does add their name to the db, but the video's do not show up.<br /><br />Here is a username and password that works - when you sign in you will notice a video tab shows up in the menu - <br />Username: lisam<br />Password: noelle!<br /><br />But here is a new user that signs up and gets greyed boxes, it will allow them to sign in but the permissions are not there, the video tag will not show up:<br />Username: adambruce<br />Password: bruceadam<br /><br />Sorry this is so long, but I am so frustrated and heads will roll if I cannot get this fixed.<br />Any help would really, really be appreciated.<br /><br />Thank You<br />Lisa<br />",

Everything works flawlessly locally but once made live, errors on pages or pages do not want to show up. Now I am getting an error on the blog page - I am not an expert at this stuff so any help would be appreciated.<br />I will try the other forum also, thank you for your suggestion.<br />",

The register.aspx... when a new user goes to sign up - then hits submit - it takes them to the default page, but they are not signed in. Click login to sign in and the new username and password are not found, nor is the info into the database. My connection strings are good I and triple checked them and nothing changed on the page except me uncommenting the address validation control (Which was what caused the previous problem I was having)<br /><br />Anyones Thoughts?<br /><br />",
