No DB changes that I can remember and I get the same error when running the unaltered version of RC1 on my development server with FF. Is there a setting in FF that could be causing this? I also got the error when running the Boy Scout sample site on your Home page. Maybe my download of RC1 is broken because I'm still having CSS issues with Printer Friendly pages also.<br />Ed<br />",

I didn't alter the database structure, but did delete some of the records that were in the RC1 download. Is it possible that I deleted something that's causing this problem? <br />",
