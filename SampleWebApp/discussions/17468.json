I had a couple of questions.<br />1.  Are you able to bulk upload photos?<br />2.  Are the photos stored in a file location or the db?<br />3.  I had gotten the site running and processing logins, but I couldn't do anything else that used the db (add events, blog entries, etc).  How did you work around on GoDaddy?<br /><br />Thanks.<br />",
