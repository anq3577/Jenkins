I'm going to download and merge my code base with the Oct 31 version soon, but here's the issue in case it hasn't been found and repaired yet.<br /><br />When viewing a forum thread  /forum/Thread.aspx?th=nnn I was getting an SQL exception: Divide by zero error encountered. <br /><br />After about two hours of debugging, I traced it down to the GetThreadPage stored procedure.  I couldn't figure out why, but for some reason it was being passed zero for the PageSize parameter.  I'm assuming the user changed something, but I couldn't see where it was.<br /><br />In any event, I added this code to the beginning of the stored procedure so that it won't crash and will display a reasonable result in the event of a bad page size parameter.<br /><br />   IF @PageSize &lt; 1<br />   BEGIN<br />     Set @PageSize = 10<br />   END<br /><br /><br />I still have an open request:<br /><br />How did they set the value to zero in the first place?  That seems like a bug.<br /><br /><br /><br />(Thanks for all the work and the great tool!)<br />",
