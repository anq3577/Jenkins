I've made a TON of coding changes to get this up and running, including recompiling the Subsonic dll to run in Medium Trust.  I merged it with the Classifieds Starter kit, added mapping to the events view, ad rotators, an xml file for tracking ad hits, and of course changed the theme, including a couple pages with flexible width in the classifieds section.  I still have some tweaking, but I am pretty sure I've got everything working!<br />",
