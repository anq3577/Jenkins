When I try doing this with these files into a VS2005 website, I have over 100 errors.  I am sure there is an easy way to install this.   I did not have any of the codegen files for the variables (.designer.vb files) and it does not seem to recognize the methods in the APP_Code directory.  I added the bin files to the references. Any ideas?<br />",
