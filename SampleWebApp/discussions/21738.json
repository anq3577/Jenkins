All of the pictures were 2 - 3 Mb pictures straight from digital camera.  I tested uploading a modified picture in MS Picture Manager (Size was about 200 Kb).  The 200 Kb picture looks better than the resized 2 - 3 Mb picture.  Is there some specific size pictures that should be uploaded for albums?  Thanks.<br />",
