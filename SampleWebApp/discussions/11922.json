I want allow them to create events, news and photos, but not edit and delete users.  I assigned them to Editors and Bloggers (not Administrator) roles and that did not change their access.<br /><br />How do i allow somebody to create events, news and photos, but not edit and delete other users?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

I added a new role to the system named \"UserEdits\".  I then added that role to the Admin member.  In the \"Admin/EditUser.aspx page\" section of the web.config, i added \"&lt;allow role=\"UserEdits\"/&gt;\".  I then added a new user, assigned that new user to the UserEdits role.<br /><br />Nothing changed.  That user still cannot add events, news or photos unless i assign him to the Administrators role.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

The only thing that accomplished, is reversing the Admin rights.  So instead of only Admin having the right to do everything, all other users have those rights and Admin only has view rights.<br /><br />Here is what i did:<br />Assigned the UserEdits role to only Admin.<br />Assigned the Administrators role to all other users.<br />In the web.config, under the \"Admin/EditUser.aspx page\" section, i changed the \"&lt;allow role=\"Administrators\"/&gt;\" to \"&lt;allow role=\"UserEdits\"/&gt;\".<br /><br />Any idea of why this is not working?<br /><br />After looking at the screens in this web site, all i really want to do is only allow one user \"Admin\", to have the \"Manage Users\" button appear.  I think that is the only thing that i want to change.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony <br />",

The buttons still work.<br /><br />However, changing this \"manusers.Visible = Page.User.IsInRole(\"Administrators\")\" in Default.aspx and Member\\List.aspx removed the buttons and that solves my problem.  The Admin can Manage Users, add to events, photos and news.  UserEdits can do the same except Manage Users.<br /><br />Thanks for all of your help.  Your knowledge is very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",
