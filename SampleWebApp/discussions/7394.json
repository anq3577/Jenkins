I cannot see these images in the images folder?<br /><br />Selecting a picture to use for an event/news item doe not appear to work for exisiting folders or uploaded images. As soon as I assign an image once, refreshed it gives me the usual crossed out white image icon like it can't find it and yet it is in the gallery?<br /><br />Thanks for stopping by...<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />MARK.<br /><br />http://www.worsleyparkgolf.mawhitfield.net<br />",
