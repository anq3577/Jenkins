I have the club starter kit running fine on my local machine but am having problem in moving it to a hosted environment.  I have added the database to the host (1and1.com if that matters in any way) using a .bak of the database and it seems to have restored fine (by confirming that all of the tables have been recreated).  I altered the connection string in the web.config to match the appropriate info from my host (e.g.  &lt;add name=\"ClubSiteDB\" connectionString=\"Data Source=mssql09.1and1.com,1433;Initial Catalog=XXXXXXXXXXXX;User Id=XXXXXXXXX;Password='XXXXXXXXX';\"/&gt;)<br /><br />Nonetheless when I try to access the website online I get the following error:<br /><br />Server Error in '/' Application.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Attempt to access the method failed. <br />Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request.
