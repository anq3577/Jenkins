I was really amazed with how little knowledge i could make and change this site to a site for my Petanque (Jeu de boules) club. I started translating everything to the dutch language and started showing this to other club members. Now i missed the option to delete Photo Albums and started googeling this. It was then that i discovered this site and i don't want to start all over again with the translation.<br /><br />Is it (simply) possible to add the option to delete photo albums, events and locations? Without having to start all over again or updating the database?<br /><br />I hope it is, oh, you can check my site out at http://dehaan.mine.nu (temporary location)<br /><br />Rob.<br />",

Thanks anyway.<br />",
