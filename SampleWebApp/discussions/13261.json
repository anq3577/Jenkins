The problem appears to be in the following piece of code.<br /><br />Public Shared Sub AddTeam(ByVal seasonid As String, ByVal teamname As String, ByVal coachmemkey As Object)<br />            Dim meminf As New MemberInfo(MemberInfo.Columns.Memberid, coachmemkey)<br />            Teams.Insert(teamname, seasonid, meminf.Memberid)<br />End Sub<br /><br />Here seasonid=\"\"  and the code in Teams.Insert() is trying to convert it to an Int.<br /><br />Has anyone ran into this issue?  Thanks!<br />",
