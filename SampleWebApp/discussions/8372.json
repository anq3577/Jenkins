So, i need to backup and restore the my DB to client's machine. <br /><br />Well, since these seems not possible; only some suggestions for export &amp; import data's etc., but my concern is, will there be primary &amp; foreign keys problem, if I do it this way.<br /><br />Or is there any other way to move the database?<br /><br />I may try the Sql2000 scripts for CSK, however, i made lots of changes to the DB. And also, if I try to script my db to Sql2000 compatible mode, i give lots of errors (asp.net memberships related). Are there any ways to correct this?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />",
