If you move the content IN the table - just create a row and a cell, and move the update button and the rest in the cell, then it should work.<br />The explanation is that the innerHtml method in IE does not like to take some structures in the string. But if you move everything in the table, then it should work. <br />Checkout how it is done in the password change form - the update button there is in the table.<br />Hope this helps!<br />N<br />",
