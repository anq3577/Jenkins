I just need to know how to format it so that it looks nicer.<br /><br />However, i will try your idea of adding a menu control.  What did you use?  The Toolbox\\Navigation\\Menu control?<br />and where did you put it on the Default.master?  Right after the Repeater?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

It's been awhile since I made those changes and don't remember why I replaced the Repeater, but it probably had something to do with formatting.<br />",

I'm using this article as a reference: http://www.asp.net/learn/dataaccess/tutorial03vb.aspx?tabid=63<br /><br />It's not going well. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'm surprised they didn't just include the code for any child nodes in the repeater in the first place. In fact, I can't seem to find an example for using a repater across teh top navigation. They all seem to be down the left side. Even just copying the example in the article without changing anything is resulting in a bunch of dots going down the left side of my screen. If anybody has a solution and would be willing to share, I'd be grateful. <br />",
