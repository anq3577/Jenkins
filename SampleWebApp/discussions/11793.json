I tried other isp's, but DASP was the only isp that i had zero problems with when installing the CSK.<br /><br />I tested sending email from the website and get an error which is at the end of this post.  I think it's because the email settings are not correct in the web.config.

I don't know your first name or i would address you as such.  Thanks for all of your replies.<br /><br />I'm not sure of what you mean by your reply.  Are you saying that i should get the ip address of their SMTP server and plug that into 'network host ='?<br /><br />I will set up an email address with DASP and see if that changes things.<br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Tony<br />",
