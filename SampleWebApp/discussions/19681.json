When you first start the application using Visual Web Developer 2008 it will ask if you want to convert to Framework 3.5.  If you do you get the following error message.<br /> \"The server tag 'asp:ScriptManager' is ambiguous.  Please modify the associated registration that is causing ambiguity and pick a new tag prefix.\"  <br />This reference is to the default.aspx page.<br />Other error messages include the following:<br />'ScriptManger ' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Web.UI'<br />'UpdatePanel' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Web.UI'<br />'UpdateProgress' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Web.UI'<br />These three appear when you open the blogs/post.aspx page.<br /><br />It seems that Framework 3.5 has the Ajax tools built in.  Would that have anything to do with this issue.<br />",
