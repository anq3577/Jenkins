The src doesn't point anywhere in RC1. This is because the database is returning a null value. This is in turn getting passed into the page.  My function simply checks if it is null and if it is, it returns ../images/nophoto.gif which will put the image that you are looking for in there as long as you have the nophoto.gif file in your images.<br />",
