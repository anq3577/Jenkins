I notice that the font you use is larger than what my site has, using the same browser settings, and I don't think I made any changes to mine. Also, the Upcoming Events and Recent Blog Posts boxes are wider than the columnright div and there are some text overflow problems with your login box as well. I really don't know much about CSS, but I do know that when you try to stuff something in a box that can't contain it, all sorts of formatting problems show up.<br /><br />Not much help, but might give you something to look at.<br /><br />Ed<br /><br />",
