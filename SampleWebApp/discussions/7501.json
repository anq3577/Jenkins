But one thing I forgot to do is at the end of the If, before the ElseIf, there needs to be a return statement, so that the last 2 lines are not executed.  Or move those 2 lines to the end of the ElseIf and Else blocks.  I see you got that in your code.  I am going to make that change to my code.<br />",
