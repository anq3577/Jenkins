I suppose this was fine, as the Schema.sql file executed fine on top of that.  However, the Data.Sql file didn't execute because of primary key issues.  I've decided to recreate it trying to only use the schema and data file and I will see how that goes.<br /><br />In the first case however, I instantly ran into the security exception issue.  I've been googling around and trying to figure out how people are successfully running with this being the case, but I can't seem to find anything.  Any help would be great.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />~Kai<br /><br /> _Description: The application attempted to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy.
