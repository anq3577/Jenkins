The forums thread (subject area) is also a problem. The rest of both pages are the problem?<br />Not sure where to look.<br />Thank you again,<br />Jim<br /><div class=\"quote\" style=\"border: dotted .1em #aaa; border-left: none; border-right: none; font-style: italic; margin: 1em 0em 2.5em 3em;padding: .2em;\"><br />FireByNight wrote:<br />the Calendar control uses the Clubsite.css style sheet.
