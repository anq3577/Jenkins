Administrators cannot do that kind of stuff now.  I assigned all new valid users to the Administrators role.  So they can use all of the adds, edits, deletes of photos, events and news, but Administrators cannot \"Manage Users\", \"Manage Forums\" and \"Send Email\".  <br /><br />Is there an easy way to make it so that only the person who added a photo album and photos can edit and delete the photos or album they created?  The way it is now, any Administrator can edit or delete any body elses photos/albums.<br /><br />Any help would be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

I'll start looking at that method.<br /><br />Well i guess if somebody posted a picture of my butt, i'd want the ability to delete it too.  Are you serious about this?  I never thought of it that way and now i'm not sure if i will really put it into effect even if i do get it to work.<br /><br />What was the idea in desinging the CSK2.0 for the Administrator role?  Should all the approved users get it or are there cases when an approved user gets either the Editors or Bloggers or both?  I never did try to figure that out.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",
