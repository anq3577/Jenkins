For instance I am\r\ntrying to use my personal cableone.net email address. I tried setting\r\nthe mail server as &quot;mail.cableone.net&quot; and the username as my username,\r\nand my password as my password. The problem is that when I try to send\r\nan email through the website, it says, &quot;<span><em>No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 72.167.82.11:25&quot; </em>and\r\nof course the email is not sent. Can you help me? Is there a certain\r\nmail server that I should use? I think it may be that the mailbox I am\r\ntrying to send it to doesn't accept it, which is its own email address.\r\nI have tried several different email addresses, so I am unsure what the\r\nproblem is..</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=left><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=left><span><span><span>Thanks tons in advance!</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=left><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p align=left><span><span><span>Josh</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=left><span><span>PS.
