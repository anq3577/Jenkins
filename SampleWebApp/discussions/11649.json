Its been much easier so far except when I try to register on the site I get this error:<br /><br />'System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider' requires a database compatible with schema version one. <br /><br />How do I fix this? Can someone direct me on how to get the site working on Ultima Hosts?<br /><br />Thanks in advance. <br />",
