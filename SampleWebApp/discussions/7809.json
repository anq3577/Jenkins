Since I am looking to change the theme slightly for a golf website, green might be more fitting. I obviously don't want to upset any lines or ripples in the image just the overall colour.<br /><br />I suspect this topic will come up again as some theming personalisation might be required by individuals trying to adapt.<br /><br />I am not that savvy when it comes to graphics so somethig easy and quickly accessible would be useful.<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />MARK.<br />",

I personally like to use Paint.NET (www.getpaint.net) if you want to change the color in there do the following:<br />- Adjustments --&gt; Sepia<br />- Adjustments --&gt; Hue/Sat.<br /><br />Then you'll need to make your choice for Hue/saturation based on the look you want.<br />",
