It does the update, but the image stays on the screen.  This also happens in other areas of the web site.<br /><br />Is there any way to make this a more user friendly experience like display a message and stop the loading.gif image after the actual updating is done?<br /><br />Any help would be gratefully appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",

In your first reply to this post, \"I think there is a div issue that caused that\".<br /><br />Now you are saying \"It should be working everwhere\".<br /><br />It's not working in the \"Update Info button on the Modify Contact Details page\" on dev machine nor the production.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tony<br />",
