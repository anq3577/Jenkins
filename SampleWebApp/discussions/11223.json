The best way to do this is in the code. On line 16 of the member/register.aspx page, I would put in the following code:<br /><br />Roles.AddUserToRole(user.UserName.ToString(), \"Administrators\")<br /><br />user was declared earlier in that try statement and you can just pull the username and assign it to the role \"Administrators\" after the user clicks finish.<br /><br />You might look at the ramifications of this, though. It might not be best to assign all users to \"Adminisitrators\" because of the actions an administrator can take such as deleting users. Think about it before you do it.<br />",

Your select RoleId from aspnet_Roles should have returned the GUID that is assigned to the Administrators role.  Since it didn't, you probably wiped out the data from the table.<br />2. You probably should wipe your database out, and restart it from scratch.  That will be the only way that you can be sure that the roles and everything is setup correctly.<br /><br />After that is completed, I would probably just put a temp ASPX file on the site.  Something like this:<br /><br />temp.aspx:<br />&lt;%@ Page Language=\"VB\" AutoEventWireup=\"false\" CodeFile=\"temp.aspx.vb\" Inherits=\"temp\" %&gt;<br /><br />&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"&gt;<br /><br />&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" &gt;<br />&lt;head runat=\"server\"&gt;<br />    &lt;title&gt;Untitled Page&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br />    &lt;form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;<br />    &lt;div&gt;<br />        &lt;asp:TextBox ID=\"TextBox1\" runat=\"server\"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;<br />        &lt;asp:Button ID=\"Button1\" runat=\"server\" Text=\"Button\" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />    &lt;/form&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;<br /><br />'temp.aspx.vb<br />Partial Class temp<br />    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page<br /><br />    Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click<br />        Roles.AddUserToRole(TextBox1.Text, \"Administrators\")<br />    End Sub<br />End Class<br /><br />load this page AFTER you create your login.  Then load this page, put your username in the textbox and click the button.  Your username should then be in the Administrators role.<br /><br />After you have one Administrator, delete these pages from the site.<br />",
