If answertable is nothing, it bombs.  I was tossed in a simple If Not(AnswerTable is Nothing) around those loops (there's two within that method) along with the count around 155.<br /><br />can someone verify this?  I didn't want to add it as a bug until I was sure.<br /><br />re-create conditions -- new install, log in as admin, delete the poll, go back to the main page.<br />",
