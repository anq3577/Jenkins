I have never used them to set up my site because I don't know HOW to use them with my host. My host has a shared DB server running SQL 2005 and does not allow remote access. This is the procedure I used to create the DB file. Please tell me if there is a problem using this method.<br /><br />1. Created an empty DB on server using Plesk admin tools provided by host.<br />2. Assigned a user and password to new DB.<br />3. Used SQL Express on local machine to make a backup of ClubDB.<br />4. Logged into remote DB server using DB admin tool provided by host.<br />5. Restored empty DB from .bak file created in step 3.<br /><br />Most things seem to work, but I'm starting to wonder if creating the DB this way rather than using the SQL scripts can create any  problems.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ed<br />",

You can read a little about it here <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/19/update-of-sql-server-database-publishing-toolkit-for-web-hosting.aspx\" class=\"externalLink\">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/04/19/update-of-sql-server-database-publishing-toolkit-for-web-hosting.aspx<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a><br /><br />This might solve other users problems as well.<br />",
