For my test the Announcement table looks like this:<br /><br />id                  item date                                             title                description                  staticURL   photo          albumid<br />22\t2007-04-30 02:22:00 PM\ttest\t&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;\tNULL\t26\tNULL<br /><br />The \"Photo\" number should have been \"3\", the AlbumId for Photo 3 is 26.  Somehow we have the albumid loading into the photo field in the Announcements table.<br /><br />Any ideas on how to fix?<br />",
