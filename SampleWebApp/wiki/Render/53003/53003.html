Hi. I&#39;m the coordinator for the Club Starter Kit project. Most of the archeitetual things and most of the development comes from my home computer :)<br /><br />I co-own a web design and software development firm (see link bellow). My free time is usually split between Club Starter Kit and my job.<br /><br />I&#39;ll probably post some more about myself later. I have some more work to do on the project! <br /><br />
