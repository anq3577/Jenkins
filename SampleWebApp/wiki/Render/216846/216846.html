<div class="wikidoc"><h1>ClubStarterKit Open Source Project</h1>
Welcome to the homepage for the ClubStarterKit open source project on codeplex. Back when Visual Studio 2005 was being built, Microsoft built a collection of starter kits that would give developers great sample applications to learn how to develop software or to simply get something running without a lot of headache. The goal of ClubStarterKit open source is to extend the original Microsoft ClubStarterKit that was released by Microsoft. By using emerging technology and new standard practices, ClubStarterKit will evolve into a community-driven project that anyone can download, extend, and publish with minimal ease.<br />
<h2>Current Version</h2>
<a href="https://clubstarterkit.codeplex.com/releases/view/36375">ClubStarterKit v3 Preview</a><br /><br />Currently, there is momentum to release a brand new ClubStarterKit code base. The new code base is written in C# and has a clear distinction between the layers of the application. It also features a modular approach to building the ClubStarterKit website. A developer will be able to choose from a  new different data access providers and database servers. Written entirely in ASP.NET MVC 2, Visual Studio 2010, and ASP.NET 4.0, ClubStarterKit&#39;s 3.0 code base will be a significant shift from versions past. For the first time, this starter kit will present developers with a concrete example of some of the best practices that are currently in use in other major projects. It is the goal of ClubStarterKit to provide a high quality sample as well as a usable website for those who simply want to get an organization website out onto the web.<br /><br />The current version is <a href="https://clubstarterkit.codeplex.com/releases/view/36375">ClubStarterKit v3 Preview</a>. This contains the new code base. Read more about the current release. <br /><br />NOTE: Because this is a preview, the documentation isn&#39;t quite ready. As we come closer to version 3 final, more documentation will be released to the codeplex site under the documentation tab.<br />
