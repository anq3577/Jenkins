<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Themes</h1>
ASP.NET 2.0 offers a great way to have different styles. ASP.NET 2.0 themes allow modularity and control over your site&#39;s theme.<br /><br />
<h2>Change themes</h2>To change themes, it takes a little edit in the web.config. Look for the pages section of the web.config (Line 130 on the default kit) where it says &quot;Theme&quot;, change it to a theme referenced in the &quot;App_Theme&quot; folder. I would use the same case as listed in the theme folder. Then you save it. That&#39;s it!<br /><br />
<h2>Make a theme</h2>Copy the &quot;ClubSite&quot; theme folder and make your own folder. Make all your edits to the new folder&#39;s CSS, skin, and image files.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
